## **Issue #1: Categorized Training Data**
**Title:** Implement categorized training data storage  

**User Story:**  
As an AI developer, I want training data to be organized into categories and subcategories so that I can efficiently manage and focus on specific areas of model training.  

**Purpose:**  
To enhance model learning efficiency by structuring training data into meaningful categories and subcategories, enabling better organization and retrieval.  

**Implementation Strategy:**  
- Define a list of categories and subcategories for training data.  
- Develop an automatic categorization algorithm.  
- Allow manual reclassification for incorrect categorizations.  
- Build an analytics dashboard to evaluate categorization effectiveness.  

**Priority:** High  

## **Sub-Issues:**

### **1. [UR-01.1] Define Categories for Training Questions**
- **Assumption:** A well-organized Q&A format helps learning by avoiding unintentional hints.  
- **Validation:** Conduct usability testing with developers to measure effectiveness.
